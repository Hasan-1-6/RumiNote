# RumiNote

Rumination means repetitive thinking or dwelling on negative feelings causing distress and other consequences. The repetitive, negative aspect of rumination can contribute to the development of depression or anxiety 

According to various psychologists. Journaling is one of the best ways to help with rumination so I decided to make it my project and make a webapp that serves as an emotional trashcan that can be logged in on both your PC and mobile

The data will be wiped ever 24 hours as intended by design to rid of brooding over the past

A new day calls for a new fresh start, So leave all your negative thoughts behind on this website and go chase out better mental health !!
